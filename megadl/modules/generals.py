**How do I login?**
  Send /login command and enter your details when I ask you. Don't worry we encrypt your data before sending it anywhere 🤗

**How to download from mega link?**
  It's very easy. Just send the link you want to download and I'll download it for you 😉.
  For private content you need to login first then send path to the file or folder you want to download starting with `/Root/<path-to-dl>`.

**How to upload files to Mega.nz?**
  Just send me the files and I'll ask you whether you want to upload it or not. Same goes for direct download links 😎
